# Forms

HTML form elements let you collect input from your website’s visitors. Mailing lists, contact forms, and blog post comments are common examples for small websites, but in organizations that rely on their website for revenue.

Forms are the “money pages.” They’re how e-commerce sites sell their products, how SaaS companies collect payment for their service, and how non-profit groups raise money online. Many companies measure the success of their website by the effectiveness of its forms because they answer questions like “how many leads did our website send to our sales team?” and “how many people signed up for our product last week?” This often means that forms are subjected to endless A/B tests and optimizations.
