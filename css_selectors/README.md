# CSS Selectors

### Pseudo-classes for links

CSS “pseudo-classes” provide a mechanism for hooking into this kind of temporary user information. At any given time, an <a href> element can be in a number of different states, and you can use pseudo-classes to style each one of them individually. Think of them as class selectors that you don’t have to write on your own because they’re built into the browser.

Pseudo-classes begin with a colon followed by the name of the desired class. The most common link pseudo-classes are as follows:

- **:link** - A link the user has never visited.
- **:visited** - A link the user has visited before.
- **:hover** - a link with the user's mouse over it.
- **:active** - A link that's being pressed down by a mouse.
