# Advanced Positioning 
The other three types of positioning are “relative”, “absolute”, and “fixed”. Each of them let you manually position elements using specific coordinates, opposed to the more semantic options in flexbox and floats. Instead of saying “Stick this box in the center of its container,” advanced positioning lets you say things like “Put that box 20 pixels above and 50 pixels to the right of its parent’s origin.”

The vast majority of elements on a web page should be laid out according to the static flow of the page. These other positioning schemes come into play when you want to do more advanced things like tweak the position of a particular element or animate a UI component without messing up the surrounding elements.
