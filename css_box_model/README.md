# Content, Padding, Border and Margin

The “CSS box model” is a set of rules that determine the dimensions of every element in a web page. It gives each box (both inline and block) four properties:

- **Content** - The text, image, or other media content in the element
- **Padding** - The space between the box's content and its border
- **Border** - The line between the box's padding and margin
- **Margin** - The space between the box and the surrounding boxes.
